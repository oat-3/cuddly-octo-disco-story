It was four in the morning and Jim is wandering around the forrest. He was on a school trip and his friends ran away from him as a joke, but when they looked back Jim was already gone.
In fact, Jim didn't go home. When Jim saw the beautiful scenery of the forest, he decided to go to the center of the forest. When he walked for half an hour, Jim saw a surprise scene.（yuxuan zhang） 
Jim ended up in the middle of a beautiful open prairie full of wild animals
gracefully wandering around. There were birds and deer, and in the center there
was a giant waterfall. Jim felt so satisfied that he chose to rest on the lawn near the lake. Jim had an awesome idea, since he likes the lake so much, he wondered if he could build a house here once he gets out of the forest.
